# Co-planar vectors resultant calculator

Calculate the resultant vector from the inputted co-planar vectors

## How to run

```shell
python main.py
```

## Expected formats

- `magnitude` N
- `direction` degrees from the vertical clockwise

## Example Output

```
Enter new co-planar vector?
[Y/n]: y
Enter vector:
magnitude: 28
direction (from the vertical): 90
Enter new co-planar vector?
[Y/n]: y
Enter vector:
magnitude: 17
direction (from the vertical): 24
Enter new co-planar vector?
[Y/n]: n

resultant vector: vector[magnitude=38.21273719858552, direction=66.02010036417545, x=34.914522932288605, y=15.530272779924214]
